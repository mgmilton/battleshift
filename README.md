This project created an API implementation of the game Battleship. After authorization and activation through an email, a player can play against another player through an API. To see all the endpoints utilized, in a game look this [endpoint explanation](https://github.com/mgmilton/battleshift/blob/master/endpoint_explanations.md). Through utilizing Twilio's API, the game also sends SMS updates after the opponent has taken his or her turn. A deployed verison of the api can be visited [here](https://battleshift.herokuapp.com/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the battleshift API up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

* Rails, version 5.1.5
* Puma, version 3.7
* Rspec-Rails

After cloning down this repository, change into the directory ```battleshift``` and run:

```
bundle
```

## Installing

To setup the database necessary for this API, run the following commands:

```
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```



## Running the tests

In order to run the test suite, run the following command:
```
bundle exec rspec
```

## Break Down of Test Suite

* This test suite implements mocks, stubs, doubles, and spies. The following common edge cases in playing a game are tested.
  1. User cannot shoot at a position not on the board
      * ```rspec spec/requests/api/v1/games/shots_spec.rb```
  2. User cannot shoot twice in a row
      * ```rspec spec/requests/api/v1/games/shots_spec.rb```
  3. User cannot shoot after the game is over
      * ```rspec spec/requests/api/v1/games/shots_spec.rb```
  4. User cannot place an extra ship
      * ```rspec spec/requests/api/v1/games/ships_spec.rb```
  5. User cannot place a ship on a location not on the board
      * ```rspec spec/requests/api/v1/games/ships_spec.rb```
  6. User cannot place a ship that in a spot already occupied by another ship
      * ```rspec spec/requests/api/v1/games/ships_spec.rb```
  7. User must place ships in same column or row
      * ```rspec spec/requests/api/v1/games/ships_spec.rb```
  8. User cannot post to a game theyâ€™re not playing in
      * ```rspec spec/requests/api/v1/games/user_cannot_post_to_game_they_are_not_in_spec.rb```
  9. Inactive users cannot post to a game
      * ```spec/requests/api/v1/games/inactive_user_cannot_post_spec.rb```
  10. User cannot login in with bad info
      * ```spec/features/user_can_login_spec.rb```
